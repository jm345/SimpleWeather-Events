# SimpleWeather-Events
Small mobile app designed to gather weather and event data for locations in New Zealand.

This app was designed with using multiple APIs in mind. The APIs in question are the OpenWeather API and the EventFinda API. Eventually I would like users to be able to enter a city and receive weather and event data. Unfortuntealy, I have been having trouble with Visual Studio so I havent been able to design the interface properly nor have I been able to make requests to the EventFinda API. Once these issues are resolved then I will continue working on this so I can get a feeling for working with multiple APIs.

I also had quite a bit of trouble getting the "dynamic" feature of C# to work properly using Xamarin (I kept running into runtime errors even though I added .dll references) so I had to use another method to solve the problem. Thankfully the documentation was nice and clear so I didnt have to much trouble with that.
